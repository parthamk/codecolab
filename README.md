# Realtime Collaborative Text Editor

Welcome to the Realtime Collaborative Text Editor project! This application allows multiple users to collaborate on editing a text document in real-time. Users can see each other's cursors, highlight text, and experience seamless collaboration.

## Installation

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all frontend dependencies.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all backend dependencies.

## Running the Project

1. Start the backend server:

   - Navigate to the `server` directory.
   - Run `npm start` to start the server.
2. Start the frontend development server:

   - Navigate to the `client` directory.
   - Run `npm start` to start the frontend server.
3. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Implementations

- Real-time collaboration using Socket.IO.
- Cursor synchronization to show other users' cursor positions.
- Text highlighting for collaborative editing.
- User authentication (optional) for secure access.
- Conflict resolution strategies for simultaneous editing.

## Learnings

Throughout this project, I've gained insights into:

- Implementing real-time features using WebSocket communication.
- Managing user presence and interactions in a collaborative environment.
- Handling conflicts and ensuring data consistency in collaborative editing scenarios.
- Integrating rich text editors and UI components for a seamless user experience.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your machine before running the project.
- For production deployment, consider configuring environment variables and securing the application.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project. Happy collaborating!
